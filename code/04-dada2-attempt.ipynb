If samples were multiplexed, the first step in FASTQ file generation is demultiplexing.  Demultiplexing assigns clusters to a sample, based on the cluster’s index sequence(s). After demultiplexing, the assembled sequences are written to FASTQ files per sample. If samples were not multiplexed, the demultiplexing step does not occur, and, for each flow cell lane, all clusters are assigned to a single sample.\""
