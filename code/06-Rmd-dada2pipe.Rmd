```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading Packages
load dada2

```{r packages}
library(dada2); packageVersion("dada2")
```
lets find the fastqs

```{r fastq path}
path <- "~/MiSeq_SOP" # CHANGE ME to the directory containing the fastq files after unzipping.
list.files(path)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
