# Joe's clear and concise methods and results will go here

## Retrieving the sequence data
instructions to download from google drive or gannet

## Run Multi QC
run multi qc on all fastqs

## Demultiplexing the dataset
ask moncho about metadata format
both forward and reverse reads

## Running DADA2 for ASV table and taxa counts
parameters?

## Downstream data reshaping
combine the tables generated from the OUTPUT
combine species
combine technical and biological replicates

## Species richness
dummy variable, sum rows

## Next Steps
next steps: will be able to replicate labs process to add to dataset, or narrow in on other questions like spawning events!
